    x "*sigh* Finally, it's 3 o'clock."
    
    x "Today felt longer than yesterday."
    
    x "Maybe because I know even less of what's going on in my classes, ever since I transferred here."
    
    x "I wish I had a license to drive or Mom would still pick me up, but I guess I gotta start riding the bus home now."
    
    x "Now where's the bus schedule? Rather, which bus do I have to take to get home?"
    
    x "..."
            
    x "Guess I'll ask the teacher over there."
    
    #show Teacher A
    
    x "Umm, excuse me?"
    
    tcha "Yes?"
    
    x "Like, which bus do I take to get to Valleybrook? It's my first time taking the bus home and I don't know the bus routes."
    
    "The teacher turns around to try to face me. She looks around to look for someone."
    
    tcha "Wait, who's calling for me"
    
    x "I was right in front of you, but you turned around."
    
    "The teacher gets startled by looking at me."
    
    x "Is there something wrong? Like there's something on my face?"
    
    tcha "Oh, no. It's just that, I thought you were...since you looked like a guy at first-nevermind."
    
    tcha "Anyways, you can take bus 18 where it'll stop just outside of Valleybrook, or you can take bus 24 to enter Valleybrook from the north end of the neighborhood."
    
    tcha "Those buses should arrive in about an hour from now, so please wait patiently and vigilantly for it."
    
    x "*An hour?! We seriously have to wait an hour for buses?!*"
    
    "I glance at her to see if see was joking, but her expression hasn't changed."
    
    tcha "Yes, you have to wait about an hour. The buses also have to pick up kids from other schools too, since there aren't enough buses to go around for so many schools areound here."
    
    x "*Sigh* Oh, okay."
    
    tcha "You can just socialize and wait here in the schoolyard for it, but don't miss the schoolbus home when it's called."
    
    x "Thanks, you too."
    
    tcha "..."
    
    tcha "I don't think I need to take the bus home, but sure. Also, don't start a sentence with the word 'like.' It's neither a noun acting as a subject or a parenthetical word to start a dependent clause. It makes no sense, and it's improper."
    
    tcha "It just irks me a little but nevermind that. Just don't forget how to talk properly for the bus drivers so they can help you get home."
    
    #hide Teacher A
    
    x "..."
    
    x "I can't talk to that teacher ever again. I don't even know her name nor do I think that she knows me, but I can't talk to her."
    
    x "Definitely an English teacher with how she got annoyed from how I talked, which makes it worse."

    "While avoiding anyone's gaze, I find a quiet, empty corner in the schoolyard to wait by myself."
    
    "I take a bag of pistachios from my bag to snack on while I wait patiently for the bus."
    
    x "*Sigh* Then again, I don't really talk to anyone anyway."
    
    "This awkward and socially inept student is me. The name's Alex King. I'm a 16 year old loner with a guy's name that doesn't fit me, and a junior in high school already."
    
    "I just transferred to this school near the start of the semester, so I really don't know anyone around here."
    
    "Honestly, I can tell that she was surprised that she thought I was guy when she looked at me, but that's not the first I've been mistaken."
    
    "Then again, I dress like a guy from wearing 'his' hoodie which is three or more sizes too big for me."
    
    #play audio crunch
    
    x "Mmm."
    
    x "I really should get different snacks, but this was all that's left of the snacks in the pantry since Mom would always eat all the muffins."
    
    #play audio nutcrack
    
    "Promptly after cracking the nutshell, I spit the empty shells into an empty waterbottle."
    
    x "This is the fourth bag of pistachios that I've gone through this week. I seriously have a problem. Speaking of problems, I should take a look at my math homework and finish it now."
    
    "I open my bag to look for my homework through the messy notebooks and binders with papers frantically stuffed in them. Although, I fail to find my homework and give up the search."
    
    x "Actually, never mind. I'll just work on it later. I still don't have an idea how to solve those problems."
    
    #play audio zipper
    
    x "It's just as frustrating and stressful here in this new school as it was last year. I don't understand the stuff in my classes, everything's just a mess, and I never get any sleep."
    
    "I take out mt thermos to get a sip of coffee, only to realize that I'm almost out of coffee."
    
    x "On top of that, I'm always tired to the point where not even all the coffee in the world can help me stay awake."
    
    x "*Sigh*"
    
    x "Story of my life."
    
    "I get up and start walking around, just people watching, casually eavesdropping on conversations, and roaming around my corner of the schoolyard."

    a "Where did you get that idea from?"
    
    x "Oh, that? It's just a silly idea, no it's a stupid idea! I'm just...umm."
    
    "I nervously try to think of a lie to dodge the question. I've never had someone ask me about this before, that I'm embarrassed that someone's pointed it out like it's really weird!"
    
    x "I just got and idea for making homemade maraccas! See, when I finish the pistachios and spit the shells into a bottle, I can make a maracca afterward!"
