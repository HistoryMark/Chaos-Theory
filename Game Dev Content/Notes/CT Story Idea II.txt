-Alex, an usual junior high school student living in urban America, lives out her boring high school life as usual despite of moving to a new town. Clueless, hopeless, and careless, she loathes every day she spends in her new transfer school with no friends or peers to spend it with. Every day, just like most students, she anxiously waits for the end of the school day...only to have to wait about an hour or so get back home on the bus. So, she waits out the time waiting on the bus in the schoolyard by her lonesome, until she comes across some of the weirdest bunch she's met. Sam, the troublesome brat from a rich family who slacks off, plays videogames, but has a hint of a kind heart despite his recklessness and selfishness. Bella, Sam's childhood friend and multi-tasking class president of her freshman class who also plays a lot of videogames and binge watching, only to sacrifice so much free time that she has a hard time keeping track of her obligations, becoming scatterbrained, but always tries her hardest. Cynthia, the mature, well-endowed, and no-nonsense senior of the group who loves to argue just to be right, but has a strong sense of justice. Finally, Ari, the enigmatic transfer student from Japan, who acts as the quiet, but wisest member of the group, but always is seen to have a frown on his face. She quickly becomes friends with them through their shared interest of videogames and starts to regularly hang out, waiting for the bus to get home together. Talking about school, work, family, then sharing in their angst about the harsh world that awaits them beyond high school. Alex, from a sheltered, shut-in, life she once lived grows to experience more than what she would expect from her life as she gets to know these four individuals with deep stories of their own.
