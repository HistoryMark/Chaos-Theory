Project Elemental Harmony
Work Title - Sylvan Odyssey
Genre- Fantasy, Action, Thriller
Prognosis
-Shun Makoto, a mysterious cleric is one of the few hundred players still left alive after 2 years of fighting for survival against monsters and other players in the game. The world is filled with magic and wonder, but also filled with dangers and the constant threat of death as the penalty of death in this game, is their own life in reality. The meta of the game is constantly shifting, modeled after the harsh natural ecosystems with competition between animals in the wild. Countless players globally have already died in the game and physically ever since being trapped in the world of Eon with no escape other than to accept death or fight their way to the deepest depths of the labrynth. After the constant wars between guilds, prevalence of monsters, and the ever-looming threat of time, Shun eventually leads his friends and many others to the final stratum, but must decide the final sacrifice. He recounts the journey he had taken to ultimately free many others from being trapped in the afterlife.

-However, Shun isn't like your usual supportive cleric that usually stays with a party; he prefers to play and work alone, saving others before himself, and trying to help others regardless of whether they may want/need help or not (while not being able to help himself.) On top of trying to be selfless, although usually being a liability, he struggles with the lack of resolve and self-esteem to kill other players and do what one must do to survive. This endangers him everywhere he goes as he is also being hunted down by multiple guilds and the PK guild 'Animal Farm.' Despite of all of this, he becomes one of the most selfless, honorable, and highly respected players in the game.

MC: Shun Makoto (JPN)

-Jason's close friend, a hardy and sturdy knight often motivated by achievement. Acts as the shield of her party...

The current valedictorian of his class, one of the strongest academically, magically, and physically around the school while as a freshman rivaling students of all classes.

Already has plenty of medical experience going on medical missions with churchers, volunteer organizations, and charities both local and abroad. Near the bottom of her class, but not failing, she studies holy and healing rites for medical and beneficial uses. She has a unusually strong affinity to holy energy from years of prayers and pious devotion. Her magic consists of a powerful holy rite passed down from her family, tempered by years of prayer and practice, that renergizes and rapidly regenerates wounded and weakened patients. Patient, pious, and devoted, but overly conservative. Wishes to be a servant to her family, community, patients, and to all.

Alyssa Rosswell - School of Alchemy     Magic|Transmutation: Shockwave
-From a large, middle class family, she enters the school through student loans in the hopes of becoming an alchemist. A dilligent and hard worker, but only ranks as a middle-of-the-pack student. She has a vast knowledge and memory of alchemy, but struggles in working as a student, despite her talent in magic. Her alchemy consists of transmuting the air around her, creating pressure gradients to eventually compress the air and cause a shockwave. Tenacious and persistent, but stubborn. Strong-willed with a belief in not being able to afford failing at any step in her journey to become an alchemist for her family.

Joe Ramirez - School of Hytech    Magic|Hytech: Rampage Mech
-From a low-income immigrant family, he enters the school of hytech on a scholarship to become an engineer. A rather carefree and lax worker, he gets grades barely high enough to keep his scholarships, but he has great intuition and a knack for magical engineering after working in his dad's mechanic garage as a child and earning a 2-year degree in a technical school while in high school. An avid problem solver and creative thinker, he craftily uses his knowledge of Hytech in many ways. As a freshman, he had already designed and built a magitech battle mech by himself, complete with armor, weapons, jets, and gadgets. Outgoing, intuitive, but somewhat lazy. Seeks to become a mechanic like his father, but mostly for enjoyment.
