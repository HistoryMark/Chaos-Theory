Player's Character:
The Loner, Alex King(17, F)
Class 3-A: Junior

Background
-Coming from an average family (despite never meeting her father) and a middle-class lifestyle. A complete loner both at school and at home, rarely conversing with her mother only to talk about academic performance, chores, and work. Currently has no actual friends in school either for rarely interacting to anyone except the teachers for matters in school. Struggles in all areas when it comes to relationships never having a friend in school and only friends in the form of family friends.

-Likes to be alone in the dark while watching tv (especially anime), reading manga, fish sandwich (she has this for lunch everyday) and bitter foods. She's also an artist on the side with her own 'differentart' page, an artist online community forum for posting and publishing art. She draws random sketches, commisions, and videogame and anime characters as her style. A fairly average build, a 5'5 (164 cm), 57 kg/125 lbs female with black short hair, brown eyes, and dark skin. Somewhat androgynous in appearance, an average look for an average person. B/W/H: 78/72/76, Her birthday is October 3rd. Alignment: Lawful Neutral

Personality - ISFP
-The usual loner stereotype, one to sit at the back of the class (usually keeping to herself watching anime). Already a junior in school, she has a poor outlook on highschool from a poor and stressful first year. Always tired from unhealthy habits, mentally exhausted from struggling with schoolwork, and low spirited from a usual and boring school life. Seen by others as cold-shouldered and stubborn from her unwillingness to interact and being tired in all aspects to do anything, but just prefers to keep to herself with work.

-She's very sensitive and unwilling when it comes to talking to other people that she will sometimes go out of her way to be alone. Easily stressed, low self-esteem, unpredictable, and a non-conformist, often she's seen as an outcast and unlike many other students in her class. Sometimes she can get really heated in arguments where she starts to take it personal and rely on feelings of hatred or contempt. Even though with such a seemingly insensitive personality, she truly yearns for someone they can trust, genuinely appreciate them despite their weaknesses, and enjoy being with to devote themselves with love, dedication, and happiness. Despite of all of this, she's still a charming, sensitive, and creative friend that holds a different world of complex thoughts inside. An aspirant and curious artist, she hopes to work as an artist to make manga and comics, but often thinks of giving up that dream.

-*Comes from a military family with her mother serving in the military, but never knowing her father, who had left before her birth. Lived her entire life moving from place to place, wherever her mother would be deployed to, making and losing friends one year after another. With this, she had given up making friends as she would see to lose them soon after, developing social withdrawal and anxiety.
