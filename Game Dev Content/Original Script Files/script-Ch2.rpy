    "After the first few months of being in the club, I'll admit I actually really enjoy hanging out at school now that to me, there's a good reason to go to school."
    
    "There's a place for me to do stupid stuff with friends and not just myself."
    
    "I really started to grow closely as friends to Ari and Cynthia and Bella helping me out."
    
    "We spend the first half of the semester just hanging out, telling stupid stories, and complaining together on how disgusting the school is."
    
    "At first, it was really awkward talking to each other, but then it wasn't."
    
    "Before I knew it, we we're closer than we thought as friends. Even for this short time we've been together, a lot has happened."
    
    "I don't even remember how many times I got myself in trouble, the amount of crazy jobs I've helped Bella with, the times Cynthia has messed with me, and Ari helping me out from the trouble I get into."
    
    "For a short time, we really grew as friends, now even lame conversations are really enjoyable for me."

    show Ari talking at left
    
    a "Yes, many of the words with silent letters are derived from old languages such as Latin where it proved to be too difficult to pronounce the original words."
    
    a "For example, the word 'mnemonic' has a silent 'm' because the 'mn' consonant was too difficult to pronounce phonetically."

    show Bella neutral at right
    
    b "Now that's a question. I know a lot of us will be going to college. I'm just gonna go to the community college here. I see myself going into journalism, I really like working in the school newspaper."

    s "That's really neat! What about you, Cynthia?"
    
    c "My brothers will put me through college, so I feel lucky for that. I'd say I would go into psychology."
    
    b "Ooh, that sounds interesting!"
    
    c "I love the idea of going into cosmetology, but you see, I'm looking to get paid a decent salary. That's nice, but I'm going into business to make some good money."
    
    b "Okay, but why do you don't want to go be cosmetologist anyway?"
    
    c "I'm looking to feed myself, okay? That doesn't earn much in this economy. Now what does earn some good money is going into business and investing."
    
    c "That's what I'll do, and if I've got money to spare, I'll go dabble a little bit in it."
