    s "Can I at least hang out with you sometimes?"
    
    x "No."
    
    s "Can I follow you around to see what's up?"
    
    x "No."
    
    s "Can I peek over and see what manga you're reading at school?"
    
    x "No."
    
    s "Can I-"
    
    x "No! Look, you're a nice guy, but I don't want to be entangled with you, okay?"
    
    x "It's not really you. It's me. I just want to be alone anyway. Just live my mundane and boring, but quiet, life alone."
    
    x "It's not like I need friends anyway. I've got what I need with me in these pages of my manga and at home."
    
    x "You're just gonna' bring me trouble and I know it."
    
    x "It's been nice knowing you, but I'd like to just go back to my own story, okay?"

    s "Oh."
    
    s "Okay."
    
    show Sam crying
    
    s "I just wanted to be friends with someone as cool as you, but..."
    
    s "I respect that you want to be alone. It's a harsh decision to choose a lonely life."
    
    s "I thought it may be tough, but I-"
    
    s "I-"
    
    s "I think you might see it as an easy, and your own road to take."
    
    s "..."
    
    "Sam sniffles upon hearing my answer."
    
    x "Sorry, it's just-"
    
    x "I don't know. I don't think I'm ready or qualified to be a friend. I'm not even friends with myself."
    
    x "I just want to figure out my own life first, before I try to be someone's friend."
    
    x "I don't want to hurt anyone from me not knowing how to be that person you want me to be."
    
    x "I'm sorry."
    
    s "*sniffle*"
    
    s "Okay. Just promise me one thing."
    
    x "What?"
    
    s "You take care of yourself, okay? Then come back and hang out with me to be my friend! You seem like an awesome person anyway!"
    
    s "Maybe I'm being naive, but I just want to find that one awesome person to be my friend that I can love and stuff, you know?"
    
    s "You might not think you might be, but you truly are in your own way, awesome."
    
    s "You just have to love yourself to realize that and find out how you can do that."
    
    s "Take care of yourself, okay?"
    
    s "Everyone needs a friend, an awesome friend that you could be."
    
    "You truly are awesome. After all, you even bothered to pick up this game and listen to this cheesy, poorly-written, and clich√© story."
    
    "Even though now may not be the right time, you at least spent the time reading a story for which you made a choice."
    
    "Being able to make a choice is so powerful 'cause one choice can change someone's, if not everyone's, life."
    
    "You've changed mine by letting me meet you, and I thank you for that."
    
    "I did meet one of my friends in a regular day out of the blue."
    
    "She may be modeled after someone in this story, but for now let's give her an arbitrary name of Miss Dee 'cause I would like to tell you another story."
    
    "I met Miss Dee randomly at a highschool dance to which some of my peers goaded me to go to the dance."
    
    "I had something with my family beforehand and I made it to the dance fairly late. I couldn't really do much about that, but I still went to the dance because I felt like I had to meet the obligation of my peers."
    
    "I saw that some of my peers and my friends were all out doing there own thing. Having their own worlds trapped in individual conversations."
    
    "I felt kind of lonely in a sea of people. Then that's when she came up to me and asked me to dance."
    
    "Or at least hang out with her since her date kind of wanted to do something else, to put it in gentle words."
    
    "I was just a young, small, naive freshman(or was it junior high, it's hard to remember) who was socially awkward, not only because I barely knew English, but also barely knew how to talk to people."
    
    "But Miss Dee was just extraordinarily odd."
    
    "She was such an animated and varied person. She loved to dance widly, her sense of speech was weird, and she would gossip bravely about her other peers."
    
    "But we easily got along together because we we're both just weird. I came from an immigrant family with strict discipline, she was from a large family with many adopted children."
    
    "Nothing in common for the most part at first. Similar interests here and there that we discovered and grew together with later, but at the time, we were weird."
    
    "I did get to know more about her from mutual friends, and met friends of friends, and so forth."
    
    "However, she was one of the few friends I really stuck with, despite knowing a lot about their friends and my peers."
    
    "She became one of my best friends in my early high school years because of how she bravely she would face life."
    
    "I was very careful, a greenhorn at how things worked in high school. Always making a fool out of myself and would fail at the most simple answers to a conversation. Most times I would be mute and just listen."
    
    "She wasn't afraid to gossip. Her life was a mess. She had extracurriculars everytime, all the time. She was comfortable talking to strangers and would be the center of the conversation."
    
    "I was a student that was always studying, because I loved to study, and eventually I became a honor student and beyond."
    
    "She would struggle to do homework and keep up in class. She was barely in the honor class due to my help and that she knows the teachers."
    
    "In many ways, complete opposites, but also similarites in how we were. I learned a lot from those shared experiences, as I hoped that my friends have learned a lot as well."
    
    "We became further friends from similar interests such as band, anime, same clubs, likes, dislikes, etc."
    
    "We became truly more than just the title of friends from going through good times, bad times, ugly times, and boring times. All those times were experiences made together."
    
    "But we became friends by sheer coincidental circumstance from random choices, to eventually meet in one moment, which could have ended in the result of nothing, or something."
    
    "Today, she lives in a different part of the country as I had moved away, but we're still friends. Not as close as before due to time, but friends."
    
    "I try to keep in touch, but I've still become too timid to do so."
    
    "Still, she became a friend that changed my life."
    
    "She's taught me much on being a friend just from talking to her everyday, as she asked to copy my homework for Pre-Calculus."
    
    "Anyone can be your friend."
    
    "Not because you're similar in anythiing, but because you exchanged a little bit of time and decided to read each other's stories for a while."
    
    "First comes respect, then acceptance, support ,and maybe a little love."
    
    "Maybe you'll get your heart broken, or your back stabbed, or be completely devastated."
    
    "But maybe, you'll also find a person that'll change your life for the better from one single decision."
    
    "Take that chance."
    
    "When you are ready."
    
    "Come back if you still don't feel motivated enough and want to read my litle story again. Please do, since it does have some of my sincerity, truth, and my own personal experience based from it."
    
    "Thank you for at least reading this far, if you've really paid any attention and didn't just press 'Auto', 'Skip', or just tapped a button on your computer furiously."
    
    "Remember that you are awesome and unique in your own way, as is everyone else."
    
    "You can and will find someone out there who'll change your life forever for the better."
    
    "There are no definite amount of friends you need, a friend is all that you need."
    
    "Now I must ask."
    
    "I also must tell you that this choice is even more important since I'm basically asking if you really want to play the game."
    
    "Give it some thought if it was you in that exact situation with all of that in mind."
    
    "Would you?"

        "Very well."

        "Perhaps right now, you do not feel ready."
        "I hope you'll give yourself courage to try again."
        "Or perhaps you were curious as to where this path of the story would lead."
        "Try again and take another chance."
        "Life has a lot of opportunities and second chances. You just have to find them."
        "Thanks for playing, and reading my story."
        "Until your next journey, don't forget to be awesome."
