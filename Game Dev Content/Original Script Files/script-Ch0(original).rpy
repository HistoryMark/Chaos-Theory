    show Sam sad
    
    s "Why am I like this?"
    
    "What?"
    
    s "I know doing all that stuff doesn't help my case, nor will it ever get her attention."
    
    s "I'm just being a spoiled brat."
    
    s "That was uncalled for."
    
    s "Then again, I can't even tell myself what's uncalled for anymore."
    
    "What did you even do?"
    
    s "Oh, I don't know. I'll try to recount some of the stuff that I've done so far for the first few months of high school."
    
    s "Blared music on the PA system, constantly annoyed everyone with the same joke,"
    
    s "Made my own bottle rocket by stealing some stuff from the chemistry lab, hacked some of the school's computers,"
    
    s "Played Marco Polo in the library, messing with the restroom signs, and blowing up paper bags in the cafeteria just to name a few."
    
    s "Some I didn't get caught for, some I got let off the hook, and some I got majorly busted."
        
    s "Recently, I falsely pulled the fire alarm on purpose, then promptly got scolded by everyone, including the fire marshalls. After the scolding, those upperclassmen beat me up for causing so much trouble."
    
    s "I've already had 4 detentions in the past couple months, and it's quite a miracle I'm not in anymore trouble."
    
    s "I'm pretty good when it came to hiding evidence to avoid trouble, but it's harder to avoid trouble for the more obvious stunts I've done."
    
    s "However, now I doubt that I'll be doing anything stupid like that for a while."
    
    "Why?"
    
    "Why do you intentionally get yourself into so much trouble? You obviously know it's wrong, especially with all the stuff you've done. I'm guessing that it's all deliberate."
    
    s "..."
    
    s "Good question. You tell me."

    s "..."
    
    "You should have a good reason for why you do all this crazy stuff, or are you just that crazy?"
    
    s "..."
    
    s "Maybe I am just that crazy. I just hate everyone."
    
    "Hatred isn't a good enough reason for all of that. Why do you say you hate everyone?"
    
    s "..."
    
    s "When I say everyone, that's not true."
    
    s "I don't hold any grudges or anything personal to anyone and everyone..."
    
    s "Except for the one who brought me into this world only to refuse to have any ounce of consideration for me."
    
    s "It's always been because of her."
    
    s "She had cared so little about me that she would always be out for work in the most important days of my life."

    s "I would always try my hardest in elementary school and middle school to get her to notice."
    
    s "Only to be told that I'm not doing enough and 'expects more out of me.'"
    
    s "She stopped caring completely about me doing well in school that I decided to completely forget that gameplan."
    
    s "So then, I always believed that she would care if instead I cause some trouble."
    
    show Sam sad
    
    s "Except, even now that's completely backfired on me."
    
    s "For the past couple months of school ever since she made Dad leave, I would just cause trouble in class."
    
    s "I got to the point that I didn't care about what would happen anymore, and now, getting into trouble like this is normal for me."
    
    s "She now hates it whenever she sees me."
    
    show Sam angry
    
    s "'I don't have problems with anyone, but it's her!', I thought."
    
    s "Those cold eyes, shrilly fake accent, and an apathetic attitude."
    
    s "She would always disagree with me and never understand."
    
    "Oh, come on. You two should be able to agree on something."
    
    s "When it came to duscussing moving out, she would never hear me out, so we would just move constantly and I wouldn't even have time to say goodbye to old friends or make new ones."
    
    "Really?"
    
    "Hmmm."
    
    "Tell me a little bit more about yourself."
    
    "Like, what you want to do in the future as a job. How are you doing in school?"
    
    s "When it comes to what I want to do in the future, all she sees in me is to follow in her footsteps. She wouldn't hear it if I wanted to try or check out other jobs I would want."
    
    s "She would always scold me for bad grades and nag me to get perfect scores, but I tuned that out a long time ago."
    
    s "I don't bother studying anymore and my grades are fairly low that I'm barely passing."
    
    "Past-times and hobbies?"
    
    s "For hobbies, she would force me to learn 'classy' stuff such as learning chess, piano, tea ceremonies, and whatever."
    
    s "She says she wants me to become a 'gentleman', but I honestly hate having to act like that to create some facade that we're fancy."
    
    s "I absolutely hate having to wear suits! The dancing, fencing, 'refined' table manners, all of this is just superficial garbage."
    
    "Well, what do you like to do?"
    
    s "I play sports and videogames, but the types I play are neither of which my mother would approve."
    
    "You may not agree with her, but truly she cares for you, right?"
    
    s "Right after I was born, all I got from her was scorn."
    
    s "She didn't plan to have any kids, nor did Dad, but at least Dad was always happy to see me for the rare times he was home."
    
    "How about your family other than her? You must have other people in your family that like you."
    
    s "Mom just saw me as a burden. She would always leave for work early, but I could always look forward to Dad coming home."
    
    s "That is until she divorced him a last year."
    
    s "No wonder she divorced my Dad, she doesn't really care for me like he did. Not only that, she doesn't really care for her family."
    
    s "Dad rarely comes home because he travels all over the world for his job as an ecologist. He comes home for every holiday for me, but he would always talk about his travels, his side of the family, and be happy to see me."
    
    s "One time, I met my grandfather from my father's side before he shortly passed away."
    
    s "I didn't get to know him much, but all he left behind was his pocketwatch that I now hold in my pocket."
    
    s "He left me some wise words probably as to why he would give me something like this."
    
    s "He was a lot like my Dad. His side of the family was all about family. Dad would always bring me gifts from him and his family when he would come home."
    
    s "Always traveling far away for his research and work, but he would always call every now and then."
    
    s "My mom, however, never talks about family, nor does she ever call me regularly."
    
    s "I've never ever heard about family on my mother's side. In fact, she never would talk or mention any of them."
    
    s "She wouldn't even come to my birthday and a lot of holidays. In fact, she works through the holidays most of the time!"
    
    s "I don't hear from her from work and whenever I tried to call her, all I would get is her secretaries telling me that shés busy."
    
    s "Even when I get a chance to talk to her, the only thing she cared to talk about was money, work, and herself, if it wasn't me doing my schoolwork, staying out of trouble, or whether I ate my meals."
    
    s "She usually never comes home for any holiday, she missed every birthday since my sixth, so I stopped bothering to go with her to virutally anything."
    
    show Sam sad
    
    s "The life of a lawyer, I suppose. She's always doing paperwork in the office and even at home, but it's like she lives a whole seperate and different life at work than she does at home."
    
    s "In her life, it seems that I don't even matter."
    
    s "The only way people ever pay attention to me is when I do something stupid that I end up on the newspapers."
    
    s "At first, she did take notice, but after a short while, she ignored all of it."
    
    "..."
    
    s "It doesn't matter what I do. She's not even family to me at this point."
    
    s "I don't feel like I belong at that big, empty mansion I have to live in, nor do I ever feel like I belong at school."
    
    s "I've never been on good terms with many people. Not my parents, neighbors, peers, teachers, nor strangers."
    
    s "Most times, people know me by her name. Always living in her shadow."
    
    "I see, you always tie a lot about yourself to her,"
    
    "But surely you have at least {b}someone{/b} to talk to as yourself and not her son, right? What about that girl from earlier, Bella?"
    
    s "..."
    
    s "It's complicated."
    
    show Sam crying
    
    s "..."
        
    s "Yeah, I call her my friend, but..."
    
    s "She's not really my friend. She's just a girl who likes to talk to me."
    
    s "..."
    
    s "I don't want to bother her with this."
    
    s "Nor anyone."
    
    s "..."
    
    s "She wouldn't understand all of this anyway. She's probably got a lovely family that loves her. Even though they're busy all the time, I can tell they all love her."
    
    s "What do I have?"
    
    show Sam angry
    
    s "Nothing!"
    
    s "..."
    
    "..."

    s "..."
    
    show Sam sad
    
    "He pauses to stare directly to the screen."
    
    show Sam crying
    
    s "But no one else will ever hear me cry."
    
    s "Or ever see any tears roll down my face."
    
    s "Or feel this pain in my heart, or in my head, or all over my body."
    
    s "Because everyday, I spend every hour in pain."
    
    s "Hurting myself and those around me,"
    
    s "Cause I'm afraid that nobody will listen."
    
    s "Above all, I hate myself for that."
    
    s "I don't have any right to hate my mom for not caring about me,"
    
    s "No right to blame being alienated by everyone for what I do, nor be angry at them because they wouldn't understand."
    
    s "I hate myself, because I'm not brave enough to do anything about it."
    
    "..."
    
    show Sam sad
    
    "Sam remembers the looks of some of the students, teachers, and others after the chaos that ensued."
    
    "Emotions from everyone involved ranged from laughter, to confusion, and anger."
    
    show Sam happy
    
    s "But you know what, I try to be harmless and somewhat helpful with all the stupid stuff I do."
    
    s "I got everyone out of a bunch of classes for the rest of the day!"
    
    s "It's all just a joke. I'm just trying to get some laughs out of all it."
    
    s "I always see other people at school miserable, so I try to break the ice by getting everyone to laugh at me."
    
    s "I don't like to see sad people."
    
    s "I try to be harmless and avoid being personal with it, so..."
    
    show Sam crying
    
    s "It's a win-win."
    
    s "Of course, some people get mad at me like some teachers, administrators, or upperclassmen giving me a bad rep, but..."
    
    show Sam angry
    
    s "I could care less about that, everyone could care less about me."
    
    s "As long as they have something to laugh to or be happy for a while,"

    show Sam sad
    
    s "It's a horrible and cruel world out there filled with bad people, and I'm one of them."
    
    s "I don't do anything good like helping out other than lying and cheating to get something for myself."
    
    s "I'm one to cheer on when a fight breaks out, one to play with fire while using fire, and..."
    
    s "One who's considered by many to be a simple fool."
    
    s "Just a fool."

    "How did you even manage to hack the school computers?"
    
    show Sam talking
    
    s "Uh..."
    
    s "I was able to find a weak point in the school's campus area network, easily hacked access into some computers by a SMTP hack."
    
    s "The school is huge with a bunch of networks all connected by school emails, which are easily accessible."
    
    s "I injected my own worm virus into the system to be able to remotely control a small group of computers in the school."
    
    "Your own worm?"
    
    s "I programmed a worm virus and hacked the school with it."
    
    "What did it even do to the school computers, you said most of your pranks were harmless. That definitely doesn't sound harmless!"
    
    show Sam happy
    
    s "The worm forced the computers in one computer lab in the school, to play a video of a grey wizard bobbing his head to a looped sax solo."
    
    "..."
    
    "That's it?"
    
    s "Yeah, that's all I did with it."
    
    s "It took the ITs in the school a while, but they got rid of the simple worm I made, then the admins made them upgrade the security in the computers."
    
    s "Kek."
    
    "Also, that bottle rocket?"
    
    show Sam talking
    
    s "Simply design a bottle that's somewhat aerodynamic with cones and fins, then add vinegar and baking soda to propel it using an acid/base reaction."
    
    s "Love making those at home, but it's something else when it's at school."
    
    "Blaring music in the PA system?"
    
    s "Sneaked into the office, left behind a well-hidden small speaker in the office, connected it by bluetooth, got out through a window while avoiding any administrators, then remotely started playing music through it with my phone."
    
    s "All the other pranks I got caught, but those three are clean."
    
    "You did all of that, while not getting caught?"
    
    s "They don't have much to prove it was me, but I guess they could suspect me."
    
    "Awfully bold of you, all in the first couple months of your high school."
    
    show Sam happy
    
    s "Yeah, you wanna hear what else is in my resumé?"
    
    "No, thank you. I've heard enough of your misadventures, but that's besides the point."
    
    "You're definitely skilled in some ways, you could definitely do something with those skills into productive things rather than pranks."
    
    "Also, would you say you feel out of place anywhere and everywhere?"
    
    show Sam sad
    
    s "...Yeah."
    
    s "It's not that I don't socialize, but I just don't get along well with a lot of people I've met."
    
    s "There's not a lot of people I haven't been forced to apologize or talk to from all the trouble that I've gotten myself into."
    
    s "I'm just a ne'er do well."
    
    "You don't seem to be a bad guy. For starters, you don't like it when people are sad."
    
    "A person who avoids to hurt people senselessly, right?"
    
    show Sam talking
    
    s "Well, I try to not hurt anyone. If anything, I'm helping them with how boring it is around here."
    
    "Still doesn't justify that you still do stupid pranks to break the rules and mess with people."
    
    show Sam angry
    
    s "Okay, fine. I'll admit that much. I know it was wrong, I'm sorry, and I'll do better okay?"
    
    s "I'll stay out of trouble from now on, since it's harder to get out of it later on."
    
    s "Is that what you wanted to hear?"
    
    s "Are you done patronizing me?"
    
    "It's not like that okay?"
    
    show Sam talking
    
    s "I'll be under suspension and much more trouble if I keep going anyway, so I guess I'll stop now."
    
    show Sam angry
    
    s "There'll be more of these lectures from the teachers anyway, so I'll just tell that myself now."
    
    "And on top of all of that, you're brave and bold."
    
    "Speaking of which, why did you pick a fight with that upperclassmen earlier? You provoked a fight, but you didn't fight back? What's the meaning of that?"
    
    show Sam sad
    
    s "Oh, that. That's just me accepting punishment I guess."
    
    s "They were mad at me before for a lot of things and the fire alarm stunt pushed some of them over the edge."
    
    show Sam talking
    
    s "So, I just said 'screw it.'"
    
    s "Let me have it."
    
    show Sam closed
    
    s "They're justifiably angry. I did some stupid stuff, broke some rules, and misbehaved."
    
    s "Soon, I'll get lectured even more by all the teachers, get put in detention, and maybe be put in probation, but I don't care."
    
    "You're not afraid of getting punished at all?"
    
    show Sam talking
    
    s "When you get into trouble constantly and break the rules a lot like I do, you accept the consequences and care less about getting punished."
    
    show Sam closed
    
    s "It doesn't matter as long as you get caught, and eventually you do get caught. Of course, you better be able to accept it."
    
    "..."
    
    show Sam talking
    
    s "Anyways, why are you telling me stuff like this?"
    
    "You opened yourself up so quickly to a stranger, but I'm just as strange on trying to understand you and give you credit on your bad deeds."
    
    "Also, it's because that shouldn't be you."
    
    s "But this is me. A spoiled, rich, brat who does nothing, but get into trouble."
    
    "At least you don't have to be like that, so you don't ask yourself why you are the way you are when you're in stupid situations like this."
    
    s "{i}*sighs*{/i}Fair point."
    
    "It's your life, your choices, and your experiences. If you just let things stay the way they are by being a troublemaker for the rest of your life, that's fine."
    
    "But don't let what has happened to you say who you are. What you are now, defines you."
    
    "The impish kid that played tricks on everyone was who you were before. Are you still going to be that kid?"
    
    "Just remember that it's always never too late to turn it all around. That one choice is really you need."
    
    "I remember this little tenet about making a difference."
    
    "In this chaotic world,"
